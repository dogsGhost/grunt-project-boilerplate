Grunt Project Boilerplate
====

A boilerplate for new projects.

bower.json contains a list of dependencies I find myself repeatedly using on projects. This should be edited before starting a new project to remove unwanted dependencies.

.gitignore with your typical list of ignored files.

src folder is where all your work is done.

See Gruntfile.js for info on grunt options and configuration.
